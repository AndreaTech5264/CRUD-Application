# Progetto-full.stack
React + Spring Boot

I used the following frameworks: React 18.1.0 + Vite v.4, Spring Boot v.3.2.1, and Bootstrap 5 to practice creating a Full-Stack project.

The IDEs used on my computer are IntelliJ IDEA and VS Code. I utilized MySQL Workbench for database management, and with the assistance of Postman, I conducted tests on the REST APIs.
